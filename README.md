### ./LLM_Evaluation/

Our code for evaluating the tool-calling capabilities of Large Language Models, just for reference because it's not well organized so far.

The eval metrics calculating function `calculate_score_ToolLearning` is in `./LLM_Evaluation/src/llm_tools/evaluation/calculate.py`

### ./DPR_Training/

The data for training the retriever DPR.
